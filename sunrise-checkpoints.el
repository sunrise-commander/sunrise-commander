;;; Commentary:

;; Beginning with version 4 of the Sunrise Commander, checkpoints were redefined
;; to be a special form of bookmarks. Unfortunately, the differences between the
;; bookmarks frameworks in Emacs 22 and Emacs 23 are so big that including this
;; code directly in sunrise.el would make it incompatible with Emacs 22. For
;; this reason both versions of checkpoints are now provided as dynamically
;; loaded extensions, so that you can decide which of them to use. To be sure,
;; this is the version I intend to further develop, as it has a richer set of
;; functions and integrates more nicely to the rest of Emacs. The other one is
;; deprecated and will eventually disappear once Emacs 23+ becomes the "stable"
;; release.

;; This extension was written and tested on GNU Emacs 23 on Linux.

;;; Installation and Usage:

;; 1) Put this file somewhere in your Emacs `load-path'. (Optionally) compile
;; it.

;; 2) Enjoy ;-) -- Sunrise should pick the correct extension automatically. On
;; Emacs 23 it will look for sunrise-checkpoints, while on Emacs 22 it'll try
;; to load sunrise-old-checkpoints. Only if you *really* want to use the old
;; extensions on Emacs 23 you may add a new (require 'sunrise-old-checkpoints)
;; expression to your .emacs file somewhere after (require 'sunrise).

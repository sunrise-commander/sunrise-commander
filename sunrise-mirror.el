;;; Commentary:

;; This is an extension for the Sunrise Commander file manager (for more details
;; visit http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Sunrise_Commander), that allows browsing
;; compressed archives in full read-write mode. Sunrise does offer means for
;; transparent browsing archives (using AVFS), but they just provide read-only
;; navigation -- if you want to edit a file inside the virtual filesystem, copy,
;; remove, or rename anything, you still have to uncompress the archive, do the
;; stuff and compress it back yourself.

;; It uses one or unionfs-fuse or funionfs  to create a writeable overlay on top
;; of the read-only filesystem provided by AVFS. You can freely add, remove or
;; modify anything inside the resulting union filesystem (a.k.a. the "mirror
;; area"), and then commit all modifications (or not) to the original archive
;; with a single keystroke. There is no preliminary uncompressing of the archive
;; and nothing happens if you don't make changes (or if you don't commit them).
;; On commit, the contents of the union fs are compressed to create an updated
;; archive to replace the original one (optionally after making a backup copy of
;; it, just in case).

;; Navigating outside a mirror area will automatically close it, so if you do it
;; you may be asked whether to commit or not to the archive all your changes. In
;; nested archives (e.g. a jar inside a zip inside a tgz), partial modifications
;; are committed silently on the fly if moving out from a modified archive to
;; one that contains it. Only if you leave the topmost mirror area you will be
;; asked for confirmation whether to modify the resulting archive.

;; Be warned, though, that this method may be impractical for very large or very
;; deeply nested archives with strong compression, since the uncompressing
;; happens in the final stage and requires multiple access operations through
;; AVFS. What this means is that probably you'll have to wait a looooong time if
;; you try to commit changes to a tar.bz2 file with several hundreds of
;; megabytes in size, or under five or six other layers of strong compression.

;; For this extension to work you must have:

;; 1) FUSE + AVFS support in your Sunrise Commander. If you can navigate (read-
;; only) inside compressed archives you already have this.

;; 2) One of unionfs-fuse or funionfs. Debian squeeze (stable) offers a package
;; for the first, which is currently the recommended implementation.

;; 3) Programs required for repacking archives -- at least zip and tar.

;; 4) Your AVFS mount point (and the value of variable `sunrise-avfs-root') must be
;; in a directory where you have writing access.

;; All this means is that most probably this extension will work out-of-the-box
;; on Linux (or MacOS, or other unices), but you'll have a hard time to make it
;; work on Windows. It was written on GNU Emacs 23 on Linux and tested on GNU
;; Emacs 22 and 23 for Linux.

;;; Installation and Usage:

;; 1) Put this file somewhere in your Emacs `load-path'.

;; 2) Add a (require 'sunrise-mirror) to your .emacs file, anywhere after the
;; (require 'sunrise) sexp.

;; 3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart Emacs.

;; 4) Customize the variable `sunrise-mirror-unionfs-impl' and select your preferred
;; unionfs implementation (either unionfs-fuse or funionfs).

;; 5) Run the Sunrise Commander (M-x sunrise), select (or navigate inside) any
;; compressed directory in the active pane and press C-c C-b. This will
;; automatically take you to the mirror area for the selected archive. You can
;; make any modifications you want to the contents of the archive, or navigate
;; inside directories or other compressed archives inside it. When you're done,
;; press again C-c C-b anywhere inside the mirror area, or simply navigate out
;; of it. If there are any changes to commit (*and* if you confirm) the original
;; archive will be replaced with a new one with the contents of the mirror area
;; you've just been working on. If you don't change the defaults, the original
;; will be renamed with a ".bak" extension added.

;; 6) You can add support for new archive formats by adding new entries to the
;; `sunrise-mirror-pack-commands-alist' custom variable, which contains a regular
;; expression to match against the name of the archive and a string containing
;; the shell command to execute for packing back the mirror area into a
;; compressed archive.

;; 7) Once you've gained enough confidence using this extension you can reset
;; the `sunrise-mirror-keep-backups' flag to get rid of all the backup copies
;; produced by it.

;; 8) Enjoy ;)

;;; Commentary:

;; This extension adds to the Sunrise Commander file manager a directories-only
;; tree view that can be used for fast navigation, as well as for several basic
;; operations on files and directories. It uses the excellent "tree-widget.el"
;; library written by David Ponce and works the same in text consoles as well as
;; in graphical environments, using either the mouse or just the keyboard.

;; For more information on the Sunrise Commander, other extensions and cool tips
;; & tricks visit http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Sunrise_Commander

;; This extension was developed on GNU Emacs 24 on Linux and tested on GNU Emacs
;; 22 and 24 for Linux, and on EmacsW32 (version 23) for Windows.

;;; Installation:

;; 1) Put this file somewhere in your Emacs `load-path'.

;; 2) Add a (require 'sunrise-tree) expression to your .emacs file somewhere
;; after the (require 'sunrise) one.

;; 3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart Emacs.

;; 4) You may have to customize the `tree-widget-image-enable' variable if all
;; you get are text-only icons (e.g. "[+]" and "[X]") in your graphical
;; environment, while you'd rather prefer looking at pretty graphical ones.

;; WARNING: If you use Slime be aware that some versions of this package include
;; an older version of tree-widget.el that may clobber the one in Emacs and make
;; this extension work improperly. At least that's the case in Debian for i386:
;; slime comes with version 21.4 of tree-widget, but the extension requires 22.1
;; or better.

;;; Usage:

;; In order to explain the different ways this extension is used, it's necessary
;; to first introduce a few concepts:
;; * A Sunrise Tree View pane displays a list of directories arranged in a tree-
;;   like structure. There is exactly one such TREE in every Tree View pane.
;; * Each node in this tree is called FOLDER and represents one directory in the
;;   file system. A folder can be in one of two states: OPEN or CLOSED. When the
;;   folder is open, its children (if any) are displayed under it in the tree.
;; * The top-most folder in every tree is called the ROOT of the tree. All other
;;   folders in the same tree represent sub-directories of the root directory.
;; * To FOCUS a given folder means to replace the current tree with one that has
;;   that folder as its root.
;; * The opposite operation of focusing a folder, i.e. showing it in the context
;;   of a broader tree, is called BLURRING the folder.
;; * Finally, to EXPLODE a given folder means to open it, then all its children,
;;   then all the children of its children and so on, as many times as the value
;;   of  the   `sunrise-tree-explosion-ratio'  option   (which  can   be  customized)
;;   specifies. This  is an additive  operation, which means that  exploding the
;;   same directory  many times  will open  more of  its descendants  deeper and
;;   deeper until the tree runs out of closed folders in that branch.

;; The Sunrise Tree View mode offers three different ways of navigating the file
;; system: with the mouse (for rodent lovers), with the arrow keys (for rookies)
;; and with other keys nearer the home row (for keyboard junkies).

;; 1. With the mouse:

;; * Meta + Shift + left click anywhere inside a pane to switch between tree and
;;   normal modes.
;; * Left click on a folder or anywhere beside it to open or close the folder.
;; * Middle click on a folder, or anywhere beside it, to just select it without
;;   changing its state.
;; * Shift + left click on a folder or anywhere beside it to focus it.
;; * Meta + left click on a folder or anywhere beside it to blur it. Meta + left
;;   click anywhere else in the pane to blur the currently selected folder.
;; * Control + left click on a folder or anywhere beside it to explode it.
;; * Double click on a folder to dismiss tree view and visit the folder.
;; * Left or Middle click anywhere on the path line at the top of the pane to go
;;   directly to the directory which path ends at that point in the line.

;; 2. With the arrow keys:

;; * Meta + Shift + down switches between tree and normal modes.
;; * Up and down move the cursor up and down (duh!)
;; * Right opens a folder if it was closed, or browses it if it was open.
;; * Left closes a folder if it was open, or jumps up to its parent folder if it
;;   was closed.
;; * Shift + right focuses the selected folder.
;; * Shift + left blurs the selected folder.
;; * Control + right explodes the selected folder.
;; * If you're in a text console and  the bindings above don't work for you, try
;;   using Escape instead of Shift (not combined -- first press escape, then the
;;   arrow key) and C-c instead of Control.

;; 3. With alphanumeric keys:

;; * C-t Space (alternatively C-t Return) - switch between modes.
;; * n, p - move cursor up/down.
;; * Space, Return - open closed folder / browse already open folder.
;; * Backspace - close open folder / jump to parent of already closed folder.
;; * C-c f - focus the selected folder.
;; * C-c b - blur the selected folder.
;; * C-Return, C-c Return - explode the selected folder.
;; * f - browse the selected folder in normal mode.
;; * v, o - view the selected folder in the passive pane, in whatever mode it
;;   happens to be at that moment.
;; * C-c C-c - dismiss tree view and return to normal mode.

;; * C-q is simply another binding for the usual pane synchronization (C-c C-z)
;;   already present in Sunrise Commander Core, which in tree mode performs the
;;   "Quick View" operation required by the OFM standard.

;; * C-u C-s, C-u C-r - "sticky" interactive search. This works like the regular
;; isearch, but when the current search is finished with a Return, the folder
;; the cursor ends on is automatically opened and a new (forward) Isearch
;; starts, so one can continue searching among the children of that folder. This
;; allows for extremely fast navigation across lengthy paths of directories with
;; just a few keystrokes. To terminate a sticky search, press C-g or (once
;; again) Return. Sticky searches can be made default in tree panes by
;; customizing the variable `sunrise-tree-isearch-always-sticky' - when set, prefix
;; the command to start a regular (non-sticky) interactive search.

;; * When AVFS support is active, press "#" to toggle the display of compressed
;; archives in Tree View panes.

;; Additionally, most of the original keybindings from Sunrise apply (wherever
;; it makes sense, of course). For instance switching/transposing/laying out
;; panes (Tab, M-Tab, C-c, C-s), showing / hiding hidden directories (C-o),
;; jumping to parent/arbitrary directory (J, j) and many more, including the
;; following file manipulation commands: copy (C), clone (K), rename (R), delete
;; (D), symlink (S), relative symlink (Y), create a new directory (+) and show
;; file size (y).

;; All directory commands from the Sunrise Buttons extension are also supported.
;; It is required to upgrade the Buttons extension to version 1R293 or better to
;; make this integration work correctly, though.

;; Hey, and don't forget to enjoy ;-)

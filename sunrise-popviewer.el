;;; Commentary:

;; This extension advises several Sunrise Commander functions in order to make
;; the viewer window "float", i.e. instead of having a dedicated window sitting
;; under the panes all the time, a new frame is displayed whenever the user
;; requests to view a file (by pressing "o" or "v") or to open a command line in
;; the current directory.

;; WARNING: This code and the Buttons extension (sunrise-buttons) do NOT mix
;; together, if you're using the Buttons extension remove it first from your
;; .emacs file.

;;; Installation and Usage:

;; 1) Put this file somewhere in your Emacs `load-path'.

;; 2) If you are currently using the Buttons extension (sunrise-buttons),
;; remove it first from your .emacs file.

;; 2) Add a (require 'sunrise-popviewer) expression to your .emacs file
;; somewhere after the (require 'sunrise) one.

;; 3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart Emacs.

;; 4) Use `sunrise-popviewer-mode' to toggle the functionality.

;; 5) The next time you invoke the Sunrise Commander, only two panes will be
;; displayed. If you press o (or v) on a file inside any of them, it will be
;; displayed in a new frame. If you press C-c t to open a terminal in the
;; current directory, it'll be opened in a new frame too.

;; 6) Enjoy ;-)

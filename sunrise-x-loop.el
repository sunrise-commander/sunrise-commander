;;; Commentary:

;; This extension adds to the Sunrise Commander the capability of performing
;; copy and rename operations in the background. It provides prefixable drop-in
;; replacements for the `sr-do-copy' and `sr-do-rename' commands and uses them
;; to redefine their bindings in the `sr-mode-map' keymap. When invoked the
;; usual way (by pressing C or R), these new functions work exactly as the old
;; ones, i.e. they simply pass the control flow to the logic already provided by
;; Sunrise, but when prefixed (e.g. by pressing C-u C or C-u R) they launch a
;; separate Elisp intepreter in the background, delegate to it the execution of
;; all further operations and return immediately, so the Emacs UI remains fully
;; responsive while any potentially long-running copy or move tasks can be let
;; alone to eventually reach their completion in the background.

;; After all requested actions have been performed, the background interpreter
;; remains active for a short period of time (30 seconds by default, but it can
;; be customized), after which it shuts down automatically.

;; At any moment you can abort all tasks scheduled and under execution and force
;; the background interpreter to shut down by invoking the `sr-loop-stop'
;; command (M-x sr-loop-stop).

;; If you need to debug something or are just curious about how this extension
;; works, you can set the variable `sr-loop-debug' to t to have the interpreter
;; launched in debug mode. In this mode all input and output of background
;; operations are sent to a buffer named *SUNRISE-LOOP*. To return to normal
;; mode set `sr-loop-debug' back to nil and use `sr-loop-stop' to kill the
;; currently running interpreter.

;; The extension disables itself and tries to do its best to keep out of the way
;; when working with remote directories through FTP (e.g. when using ange-ftp),
;; since in these cases the execution of file transfers in the background should
;; be managed directly by the FTP client.

;; It was written on GNU Emacs 23 on Linux, and tested on GNU Emacs 22 and 23
;; for Linux and on EmacsW32 (version 22) for Windows.

;;; Installation and Usage:

;; 1) Put this file somewhere in your Emacs `load-path'.

;; 2) Add a (require 'sunrise-x-loop) expression to your .emacs file somewhere
;; after the (require 'sunrise-commander) one.

;; 3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart Emacs.

;; 4) The next time you need to copy of move any big files, just prefix the
;; appropriate command with C-u.

;; 5) Enjoy ;-)

;; 6) You can use `unload-feature' to get rid of the provided functionality
;; completely.

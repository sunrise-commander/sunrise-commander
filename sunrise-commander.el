;;; Commentary:

;; Here is another two-pane mc emulation layer for Emacs. It's built on top of
;; Dired and takes advantage of all its features, offering at the same time the
;; double pane interface I'd been missing so badly since I started using regu-
;; larly Emacs (for everything!). I tried both Ilya Zakharevich's nc.el and
;; Kevin Burton's mc.el, but none of them was what I was looking for (though
;; mc.el was near the ideal).

;; A lot of this code was once adapted from Kevin's mc.el, but it has evolved
;; quite a bit since then. Another part (the code for file copying and renaming)
;; derives originally from the Dired extensions written by Kurt Nørmark for LAML
;; (http://www.cs.aau.dk/~normark/scheme/distribution/laml/).

;; I have added to the mix many useful functions:

;; * Sunrise is implemented as a derived major mode confined inside the pane
;; buffers, so its buffers and Dired ones can live together without easymenu or
;; viper to avoid key binding collisions.

;; * It automatically closes unused buffers and tries to never keep open more
;; than the one or two used to display the panes.

;; * Each pane has its own history ring: press M-y / M-u for moving backwards /
;; forwards in the history of directories.

;; * Press M-t to swap (transpose) the panes.

;; * Press C-= for "smart" file comparison using `ediff'. It compares together
;; the first two files marked on each pane or, if no files have been marked, it
;; assumes that the second pane contains a file with the same name as the
;; selected one and tries to compare these two. You can also mark whole lists of
;; files to be compared and then just press C-= for comparing the next pair.

;; * Press = for fast "smart" file comparison -- like above, but using regular
;; diff.

;; * Press C-M-= for directory comparison (by date / size / contents of files).

;; * Press C-c C-s to change the layout of the panes (horizontal/vertical/top)

;; * Press C-c / to interactively refine the contents of the current pane using
;; fuzzy (a.k.a. flex) matching, then:
;;    - press Delete or Backspace to revert the buffer to its previous state
;;    - press Return, C-n or C-p to exit and accept the current narrowed state
;;    - press Esc or C-g to abort the operation and revert the buffer
;;    - use ! to prefix characters that should NOT appear after a given position
;; Once narrowed and accepted, you can restore the original contents of the pane
;; by pressing g (revert-buffer).

;; * Sticky search: press C-c s to launch an interactive search that will remain
;; active from directory to directory, until you hit a regular file or press C-g

;; * Press C-x C-q to put the current pane in Editable Dired mode (allows to
;; edit the pane as if it were a regular file -- press C-c C-c to commit your
;; changes to the filesystem, or C-c C-k to abort).

;; * Press y to recursively calculate the total size (in bytes) of all files and
;; directories currently selected/marked in the active pane.

;; * Sunrise VIRTUAL mode integrates dired-virtual mode to Sunrise, allowing to
;; capture find and locate results in regular files and to use them later as if
;; they were directories with all Dired and Sunrise operations at your
;; fingertips.
;; The results of the following operations are displayed in VIRTUAL mode:
;;    - find-name-dired (press C-c C-n),
;;    - find-grep-dired (press C-c C-g),
;;    - find-dired      (press C-c C-f),
;;    - locate          (press C-c C-l),
;;    - list all recently visited files (press C-c C-r -- requires recentf),
;;    - list all directories in active pane's history ring (press C-c C-d).

;; * Supports AVFS (http://avf.sourceforge.net/) for transparent navigation
;; inside compressed archives (*.zip, *.tgz, *.tar.bz2, *.deb, etc. etc.)
;; You need to have AVFS with coda or fuse installed and running on your system
;; for this to work, though.

;; * Opening terminals directly from Sunrise:
;;    - Press C-c C-t to inconditionally open a new terminal into the currently
;;      selected directory in the active pane.
;;    - Use C-c t to switch to the last opened terminal, or (when already inside
;;      a terminal) to cycle through all open terminals.
;;    - Press C-c T to switch to the last opened terminal and change directory
;;      to the one in the current directory.
;;    - Press C-c M-t to be prompted for a program name, and then open a new
;;      terminal using that program into the currently selected directory
;;      (eshell is a valid value; if no program can be found with the given name
;;      then the value of `sr-terminal-program' is used instead).

;; * Terminal integration and Command line expansion: integrates tightly with
;; `eshell' and `term-mode' to allow interaction between terminal emulators in
;; line mode (C-c C-j) and the panes: the most important navigation commands
;; (up, down, mark, unmark, go to parent dir) can be executed on the active pane
;; directly from the terminal by pressing the usual keys with Meta: <M-up>,
;; <M-down>, etc. Additionally, the following substitutions are automagically
;; performed in `eshell' and `term-line-mode':
;;     %f - expands to the currently selected file in the left pane
;;     %F - expands to the currently selected file in the right pane
;;     %m - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the left pane
;;     %M - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the right pane
;;     %n - expands to the list of names of all marked files in the left pane
;;     %N - expands to the list of names of all marked files in the right pane
;;     %d - expands to the current directory in the left pane
;;     %D - expands to the current directory in the right pane
;;     %a - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the active pane
;;     %A - expands to the current directory in the active pane
;;     %p - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the passive pane
;;     %P - expands to the current directory in the passive pane

;; * Cloning of complete directory trees: press K to clone the selected files
;; and directories into the passive pane. Cloning is a more general operation
;; than copying, in which all directories are recursively created with the same
;; names and structures at the destination, while what happens to the files
;; within them depends on the option you choose:
;;    - "(D)irectories only" ignores all files, copies only directories,
;;    - "(C)opies" performs a regular recursive copy of all files and dirs,
;;    - "(H)ardlinks" makes every new file a (hard) link to the original one
;;    - "(S)ymlinks" creates absolute symbolic links for all files in the tree,
;;    - "(R)elative symlinks” creates relative symbolic links.

;; * Passive navigation: the usual navigation keys (n, p, Return, U, ;) combined
;; with Meta allow to move across the passive pane without actually having to
;; switch to it.

;; * Synchronized navigation: press C-c C-z to enable / disable synchronized
;; navigation. In this mode, the passive navigation keys (M-n, M-p, M-Return,
;; etc.) operate on both panes simultaneously. I've found this quite useful for
;; comparing hierarchically small to medium-sized directory trees (for large to
;; very large directory trees one needs something on the lines of diff -r
;; though).

;; * And much more -- press ? while in Sunrise mode for basic help, or h for a
;; complete list of all keybindings available (use C-e and C-y to scroll).

;; There is no help window like in MC, but if you really miss it, just get and
;; install the sunrise-x-buttons extension.

;; It was written on GNU Emacs 24 on Linux and tested on GNU Emacs 22, 23 and 24
;; for Linux and on EmacsW32 (version 23) for Windows. I have also received
;; feedback from users reporting it works OK on the Mac. It does not work either
;; on GNU Emacs 21 or XEmacs -- please drop me a line if you would like to help
;; porting it. All contributions and/or bug reports will be very welcome.

;; For more details on the file manager, extensions and cool tips & tricks visit
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Sunrise_Commander

;;; Installation and Usage:

;; 1) Put this file somewhere in your Emacs `load-path'.

;; 2) Add a (require 'sunrise-commander) to your .emacs file.

;; 3) Choose some unused extension for files to be opened in Sunrise VIRTUAL
;; mode and add it to `auto-mode-alist', e.g. if you want to name your virtual
;; directories like *.svrm just add to your .emacs file a line like the
;; following:
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.srvm\\'" . sr-virtual-mode))

;; 4) Evaluate the new lines, or reload your .emacs file, or restart Emacs.

;; 5) Type M-x sunrise to invoke the Sunrise Commander (or much better: bind the
;; function to your favorite key combination). The command `sunrise-cd' invokes
;; Sunrise and automatically selects the current file wherever it is in the
;; filesystem. Type h at any moment for information on available key bindings.

;; 6) Type M-x customize-group <RET> sunrise <RET> to customize options, fonts
;; and colors (activate AVFS support here, too).

;; 7) Enjoy :)

        q, C-x k ...... quit Sunrise Commander, restore previous window setup
        M-q ........... quit Sunrise Commander, don't restore previous windows

Additionally, the following traditional commander-style keybindings are provided
\(these may be disabled by customizing the `sr-use-commander-keys' option):

        F2 ............ go to directory
        F3 ............ quick visit selected file
        F4 ............ visit selected file
        F5 ............ copy marked (or current) files and directories
        F6 ............ rename marked (or current) files and directories
        F7 ............ create new directory
        F8 ............ delete marked (or current) files and directories
        F10 ........... quit Sunrise Commander
        C-F3 .......... sort contents of current pane by name
        C-F4 .......... sort contents of current pane by extension
        C-F5 .......... sort contents of current pane by time
        C-F6 .......... sort contents of current pane by size
        C-F7 .......... sort contents of current pane numerically
        S-F7 .......... soft-link selected file/directory to passive pane
        Insert ........ mark file
        C-PgUp ........ go to parent directory

Any other dired keybinding (not overridden by any of the above) can be used in
Sunrise, like G for changing group, M for changing mode and so on.

Some more bindings are available in terminals opened using any of the Sunrise
functions (i.e. one of: C-c t, C-c T, C-c C-t, C-c M-t):

        C-c Tab ....... switch focus to the active pane
        C-c t ......... cycle through all currently open terminals
        C-c T ......... cd to the directory in the active pane
        C-c C-t ....... open new terminal, cd to directory in the active pane
        C-c ; ......... follow the current directory in the active pane
        C-c { ......... shrink the panes vertically as much as possible
        C-c } ......... enlarge the panes vertically as much as possible
        C-c \\ ......... restore the size of all windows back to «normal»
        C-c C-j ....... put terminal in line mode
        C-c C-k ....... put terminal back in char mode

The following bindings are available only in line mode (eshell is considered to
be *always* in line mode):

        M-<up>, M-P ... move cursor up in the active pane
        M-<down>, M-N . move cursor down in the active pane
        M-Return ...... visit selected file/directory in the active pane
        M-J ........... go to parent directory in the active pane
        M-G ........... refresh active pane
        M-Tab ......... switch to passive pane (without leaving the terminal)
        M-M ........... mark selected file/directory in the active pane
        M-Backspace ... unmark previous file/directory in the active pane
        M-U ........... remove all marks from the active pane
        C-Tab ......... switch focus to the active pane

In a terminal in line mode the following substitutions are also performed
automatically:

       %f - expands to the currently selected file in the left pane
       %F - expands to the currently selected file in the right pane
       %m - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the left pane
       %M - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the right pane
       %n - expands to the list of names of all marked files in the left pane
       %N - expands to the list of names of all marked files in the right pane
       %d - expands to the current directory in the left pane
       %D - expands to the current directory in the right pane
       %a - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the active pane
       %A - expands to the current directory in the active pane
       %p - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the passive pane
       %P - expands to the current directory in the passive pane
       %% - inserts a single % sign.

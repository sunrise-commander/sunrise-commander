;;; Commentary:

;; Here is a small extension that may be of help to new users who want to get
;; acquainted fast with the most frequent functions found in the Sunrise
;; Commander and their keybindings. Once installed, it displays a panel with
;; mouse clickable buttons that show some of the most useful actions performed
;; by Sunrise and their respective bindings in the bottom window (a.k.a. viewer
;; window here) every time the main panels are invoked. You can execute any of
;; these functions by clicking the appropriate button, but the extension was
;; conceived more as a simple cheat sheet (a very, very limited one, as you can
;; easily learn by pressing the last button, labeled "More...") than as a real
;; interface to Sunrise and Dired functions. Eventually, if you like this kind
;; of interaction with the program you can add your own commands to the list and
;; let this extension manage the creation and layout of the buttons for you.

;; This extension was developed on GNU Emacs 23 on Linux, and tested on
;; GNU Emacs 22 and 23 for Linux and on EmacsW32 (version 22) for Windows.

;;; Installation and Usage:

;; 1) Put this file somewhere in your Emacs `load-path'.

;; 2) Add a (require 'sunrise-x-buttons) to your .emacs file, preferably right
;; after (require 'sunrise-commander).

;; 3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart Emacs.

;; That's it - the next time you activate Sunrise you'll see a nice button panel
;; in the viewer window.

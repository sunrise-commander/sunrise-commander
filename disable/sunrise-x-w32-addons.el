;;; Commentary:

;; This extension implements a listing of all Windows drives and special folders
;; inside the Sunrise Commander, as well as support for *.lnk shortcuts for all
;; file system operations inside Sunrise. Only standard Windows shortcuts are
;; currently supported.

;; *WARNING!* this extension is targeted at Emacs ports that run directly on the
;; Windows file system (like EmacsW32 and... are there any others?) if yours is
;; running on top of some simulation layer (like Cygwin does) that maps the file
;; system this code is of no use to you.

;; It was developed on EmacsW32 (version 23.1.50.1, patched) for Windows, during
;; the Hackergarten session at the GeeCon 2011 conference in Cracow. Thanks go
;; to Andreas Ames for beta-testing this code.

;;; Installation:

;; (These are generic installation instructions -- if you installed via ELPA you
;; don't need to follow them).

;; 1) Put this file somewhere in your Emacs `load-path'.

;; 2) Add a (require 'sunrise‐x‐w32-addons) expression to your .emacs file after
;; the (require 'sunrise‐commander) one.

;; 3) Evaluate the new expression, or reload your .emacs file, or restart Emacs.

;;; Usage:

;; * The "Windows Drives and Special Folders" pane can be accessed in two ways:
;; 1) by pressing "C-c w" anywhere in the file system, or
;; 2) by navigating "up" (J) from a  top-level directory in any drive or network
;; share.

;; * Windows shortcuts are resolved automatically and, as long as a shortcut can
;; be resolved to an existing file, all operations (*INCLUDING DELETION!!!*) are
;; performed directly on that file. If you want to operate on shortcuts you must
;; first disable shortcut resolution by customizing the
;; `sr-w32-follow-shortcuts' flag and setting it to false.

;; * Virtual directories (i.e. directories containing a "target.lnk" shortcut to
;; another directory) are also dereferenced automatically. If you need to modify
;; the properties (Desktop.ini) of such a folder use the
;; `sr-w32-follow-shortcuts' flag as described above.

;; Enjoy ;-)
